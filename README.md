# Personal Blog App

This is a tutorial blog app linked with the Contentful CMS. Its main purpose is simply a place where I'll post some tips/tricks or realizations I've discovered while coding. 

### Icebox Features:
- [ ] implement pagination for blog entries
- [ ] implement a search bar that will track hashtags (may have to retroactively add tags to older posts)
- [ ] try and link Google Firebase so I can perform crud on the website itself
